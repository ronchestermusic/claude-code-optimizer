# claude-code-optimizer

> **Codename:** stackshift &middot; **Version:** 0.1 &middot; **Author:** [Ron Chester](https://github.com/ronchestermusic) — artist · studio owner · building tools for the music business · Toronto

A Claude Code skill that audits your AI dev stack, hunts down new plugins / skills / MCP servers worth installing, asks before changing anything, installs what you approve, and prints a dated PDF report to your Desktop.

**Run it once a month. Keep your stack sharp.**

## 💭 &nbsp; Why I built it

I'm an artist and studio owner in Toronto building tools for the music business. Claude Code is the spine of how I work — sketching releases, automating studio admin, prototyping ideas for other artists.

But new plugins ship weekly. New MCP servers ship weekly. Tracking all of it is a part-time job nobody asked for.

So I built a skill that does the tracking for me, on a schedule I control, with **receipts** (the PDF) so I remember what I added and why.
